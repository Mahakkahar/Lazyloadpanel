# Lazyloadpanel
A lazy load panel is a technique used in web development to improve performance by loading content  only when it becomes visible to the user, typically as they scroll down a page. Instead of loading everything upfront, lazy loading defers loading of non-essential resources until they're needed, saving bandwidth and improving page load times.
